### Configuring PyCharm and GitHub

<a name="wingh"></a>

[Jump to Mac OS: Config for Mac](#macgh)

#### Windows 

**1.** Launch PyCharm Edu. This is what you should see below on your homescreen.

<img src="images/startmenu.png" width="50%" />

**1.** Select ‘Get from Version Control’. 

**3. Download and install Git if you have not already on the ‘Repository URL’ tab.** <-- This is very important

Select ‘GitHub’ and then select ‘Log In via GitHub’.’

<img src="images/winlogingithub.png" width="50%" />

**4.** Login and authorize PyCharm Edu to use GitHub. Once you finish, you will get this message on JetBrains’ website. 

Now that GitHub is connected and installed, now you can clone your folder. 
Find, then clone your repository inside of the ‘CS-1114’ folder that we created earlier. 

<img src="images/winclone.png" width="50%" />

This should happen if everything is done correctly. 

<img src="images/winclone2.png" width="50%" />

**5.** In order to run your code, you will have to configure your virtual environment. You should have a yellow bar across the top of your screen. Select ‘Configure Python interpreter’ and then select ‘Add interpreter…’

<img src="images/addinterpreter.png" width="50%" />

**6.** Refer to this link [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/configuring-local-python-interpreters.html) to set up your interpreter. 

**7.** Change the code a little bit. 

Now let’s work on committing. Press ‘Alt+`’. This will bring up the window below. Select ‘1.Commit…’

<img src="images/vcstab.png" width="50%" />

**8.** This should bring up a side panel that prompts you for your commit message. Enter in a message with the details of what you changed. The ‘Commit’ button should be blue. Click on the down arrow next to the ‘Commit’ button and select ‘Commit and Push…’

<img src="images/wincommit.png" width="50%" />

A last message will pop up where you will confirm that you want to push commits to GitHub. 

<img src="images/winpush.png" width="50%" />

[Next Section: (Optional) Installing GitHub Desktop](#gitdesk)

#### Mac OS 

<a name="macgh"></a>

**1.** When you first open PyCharm, it will ask you where you would like to bring your file in from. Select "Get from Version Control"

<img src="images/getfromvc.png" width="50%" />

**Download and install Git if you have not already on the ‘Repository URL’ tab.** <-- This is very important

**2.** Select GitHub, and then login. 

<img src="images/pygit.png" width="50%" />

**3.** Login using your GitHub credentials and request access for the repositories for the class. 

<img src="images/gitreqaccess.png" width="50%" />

**4.** Once you authorize GitHub, your repositories should appear, along with your GitHub username in the PyCharm Version Control Window. 

**5.** Select the repository you want to work in and then hit clone. Your repository will open inside of PyCharm. 

### Virtual Environment

If you get a virtual environment error (yellow bar at the top of your screen), you need to set up a virtual environment. 

<img src="images/venverror.png" width="50%" />

To remedy this situtation, follow these steps.

**1.** In order to run your code, you will have to configure your virtual environment. You should have a yellow bar across the top of your screen. Select ‘Configure Python interpreter’ and then select ‘Add interpreter…’

<img src="images/addinterpreter.png" width="50%" />

**6.** Refer to this link [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/configuring-local-python-interpreters.html) to set up your interpreter. 

### Commit/Push Sequence using PyCharm

This part is extremely important because this is how you submit your assignments for grading! It is imperative that you understand how the 'Commit-Push/Pull' sequence works. 

**1.** After you make your changes to the file, select the 'Commit' checkmark in the bottom right hand corner of the screen. 

<img src="images/commit.png" width="50%" />

**2.** A box will pop up with information regarding your commit. You will have a space to enter in a message about your commit (a). Select the drop down menu, and then press 'Commit and Push'.

<img src="images/commitandpush.png" width="50%" />

**3.** After this, another textbox will pop up and you will confirm that you want to push the commits that you have staged. Hit 'Push' to confirm. 

<img src="images/push.png" width="50%" />

## Step 3: (Optional) Installing GitHub Desktop 

[Skip This Section](#assignment)

**1.** Visit this [website](https://desktop.github.com/) and choose your operating system to download GitHub Desktop.

<img src="images/ghdesktop.png" width="50%" />

<a name="windesk"></a>

### Windows

Follow directions on website. 

<a name="macdesk"></a>

### Mac OS  

**2.** Install the GitHubDesktop zip file. 

<img src="images/ghdesktophome.png" width="50%" />

**3.** You may get this warning when you install on Mac OS - it is OK. 

<img src="images/warning.png" width="50%" />

**4.** Sign in to GitHub.com using your GitHub account. 

<img src="images/loginandauthorize.png" width="50%" />

**5.** Login and authorize GitHub Desktop to be used.

**6.** Cycle through the instructions and grant GitHub Desktop permission and access to the folders that you are working in.

<img src="images/authorize.png" width="50%" />

**7.** Once you have finished authorizing GitHub Destktop, now you can choose the corresponding repository to work in. 

<img src="images/complete.png" width="50%" />

**8.** Find your example repository (for you it may be different), and select it. 

**9.** Select the option to clone your target repository. You will be presented with a screen that asks you for your local path inside of your machine. 

<img src="images/clonerepo.png" width="50%" />

**10.** Choose the correct local path. In our case, you are looking for the 'CS-1114' Folder. Once you have selected the correct folder, select 'Open'.

<img src="images/selectrepo.png" width="50%" />

<img src="images/correctrepo.png" width="50%" />

**11.** Now that your repo is selected, and you have successfully cloned the correct file onto your machine, now you have to open it in your code editor of choice (for this class, it is recommended that you use PyCharm). If your default editor is not PyCharm, this is how you change it. 

<img src="images/reposelected.png" width="50%" />

***11.1*** Select your preferred editor (PyCharm is recommended for this class).

<img src="images/selecteditor.png" width="50%" />

**12. Your First Commit!** - Now that you have configured everything, now you will commit your changes to GitHub. Type in your message, and select 'Commit to master'

<img src="images/firstcommit.png" width="50%" />

***12.1*** We are not done yet! Now we have to push our commits to the 'Origin Remote'. Push 'Push Origin', and once it finishes, congratulations! You have pushed your first commit to GitHub. 

<img src="images/notdoneyet.png" width="50%" />

## Step 3: Hello World Assignment

First clone your repository so you can begin working on it. 

Open PyCharm Edu and select 'Get from Version Control'.

Select the GitHub tab and then select your assignment and open it inside of your 'CS-1114' directory. 

<img src="images/selrepo.png" width="100%" />

When we are finished cloning our repository, this is what we will see:

<img src="images/whatwewillsee.png" width="100%" />

In this assignment, you will be tasked with creating a `Hello World` file.

The starter code has been provided for you in the file `hello_world.py`. Open the from 'GitHub Desktop' inside of 'PyCharm' and modify the file so that it prints "Hello World".

```out 
def main():
    """ Displays 'Hello World'"""
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

**1.** First, replace `pass` with `print('Hello')`. Run your code (Green Play Button). What happened? Commit and push your changes to GitHub. What happened? write it down in a comment, using `'''Summary 1:` before your comment, and `'''` to denote at the end. It should look something like this:

```out 
def main():
    """ Displays 'Hello World'"""
    print('Hello')
    '''Summary (1): It did something!'''

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

After you commit, you should receive an email that looks like this:

<img src="images/failed.png" width="50%" />

Click on 'View results' and it should take you to this page. 

<img src="images/actions.png" width="100%" />

The actions page will tell you what is going on. This is where you can view the results of your tests. Click on 'Autograding' and then select the 'Run education/autograding@v1' tab. This will open a drop down that has the results of your test, which should look like the following. 

<img src="images/whathappened.png" width="50%" />

Notice that the output says it did not match the expected output.

**2.** Comment out the `'print('Hello')'` statement, and Make the corresponding changes. Start a new line in which you output `'Hello World'` to the console. Run your code. What happened? Commit and push the changes to GitHub.

```out 
def main():
    """ Displays 'Hello World'"""
    # print('Hello')
    '''Summary (1): It did something!'''
    
    print('Random Things Inside of Here')
    '''Summary (2): It did something!'''

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

You should **NOT** receive an email if it is done correctly. To double check, go back to the 'Actions' tab and select 'Autograding'. Make sure that your 'Run education/autograding@v1' looks exactly like this:

<img src="images/passed.png" width="50%" />

## Congratulations! You have just completed your first assignment! 

### If you are still having issues...

When you select Commit in your VCS menu (Mac: `Command+K`, Windows: `alt+K`) it will bring up a commit dialog box. 

<img src="images/commitMe.png" width="100%" />

Push your commit to GitHub. 

<img src="images/pushtogithub.png" width="100%" />

## Reverting to Previous Versions 

The benefit of Git is that every time you commit and push your changes, a copy of your code at that point in time. 

To use PyCharm to revert to previous changes, take a look at this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xx-oIxAR-u0).
